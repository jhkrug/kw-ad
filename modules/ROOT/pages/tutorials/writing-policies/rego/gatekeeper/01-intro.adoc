= Gatekeeper support

[NOTE]
====
Gatekeeper support starts from these releases:

* kwctl: v0.2.0
* policy-server: v0.2.0
====Gatekeeper is a project targeting Kubernetes with out-of-the-box features for integration.

== Compatibility with existing policies

All existing Gatekeeper policies should be compatible with Kubewarden as explained in this chapter.

If you find this not to be true, for your Gatekeeper policies, report it, and weâ€™ll work to ensure your Gatekeeper policy runs with Kubewarden.

Policies need compilation with the `opa` CLI to `wasm` target.

For policy execution, you can read more about the Open Policy Agent link:../builtin-support[built-in support] in Kubewarden.
