Raw policies are policies that can evaluate arbitrary JSON documents. For more information about raw policies, please refer to the link:../../../../howtos/raw-policies.md[raw policies] page.

== Example

The following examples should look familiar if you completed the link:02-create-policy.md[validation] page of this tutorial.

[NOTE]
====
Remember to mark the policy as `raw`, by using the `policyType` field in the `metadata.yml` configuration. Please refer to the link:../../metadata.md[metadata] specification for more information.
======= Validation

Youâ€™re going to write a policy that accepts a request in the following format:

[source,json]
----
{
  "request": {
    "user": "alice",
    "action": "read",
    "resource": "products"
  }
}
----

It validates that only the `admin` user can delete resources.

Start by scaffolding a policy by using the https://github.com/kubewarden/opa-policy-template[OPA policy template].

First you need to change the `policy.rego` file to look like this:

[source,rego]
----
package validation

deny[msg] {
    input.request.action == "delete"
    input.request.user != "admin"
    msg := sprintf("user %v is not allowed to delete resources", [input.request.user])
}
----

The `utility/policy.rego` module must needs modification to remove Kubernetes-specific code:

[source,rego]
----
package policy

import data.validation

main = {
    "response": response,
}

// highlight-start
# OPA policy responses need the uid field to be set.
# If the request doesn't contain a uid, set it to an empty string.
default uid = ""

uid = input.request.uid
// highlight-end

response = {
    "uid": uid,
    "allowed": false,
    "status": {"message": reason},
} {
    reason = concat(", ", validation.deny)
    reason != ""
} else = {
    "uid": uid,
    "allowed": true,
} {
    true
}
