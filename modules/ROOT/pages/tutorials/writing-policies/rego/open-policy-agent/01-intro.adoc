= Introduction to Open Policy Agent

[NOTE]
====
Open Policy Agent support has been introduced starting from these releases: * kwctl: v0.2.0 * policy-server: v0.2.0
====Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a general purpose policy framework that uses the Rego language to write policies.

== Introduction

Rego policies work by receiving an input to evaluate, and produce an output as a response. In this sense, OPA has no specific tooling for targeting writing policies for Kubernetes.

Specifically, policies in OPA receive a JSON input and produce a JSON output. The OPA server is configured to receive admission review requests from Kubernetes. The policies receive a Kubernetes `AdmissionReview` object in JSON format. They have to return a valid `AdmissionReview` object as the evaluation results.

== Compatibility with existing policies

All policies can be compiled to the `wasm` target (WebAssembly) with the official `opa` CLI tool.

In terms of policy execution, you can read more about the link:../builtin-support[OPA built-in support] implemented in Kubewarden.
