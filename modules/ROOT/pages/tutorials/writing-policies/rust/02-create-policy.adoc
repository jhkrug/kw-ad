= Creating a policy

As an example, you create a simple validation policy that processes Pod creation requests.

The policy looks at the `metadata.name` attribute of the Pod and rejects pods having an invalid name. Itâ€™s list of invalid names should be configurable by end users of the policy.

The policy settings look something like:

[source,yaml]
----
invalid_names:
- bad_name1
- bad_name2
----

The policy should accept the creation of a Pod like the following one:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
// highlight-next-line
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
----

It should reject the creation of a Pod like:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
// highlight-next-line
  name: bad_name1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
----

== Scaffolding the new policy project

You can create a new policy project by using `cargo generate` with the https://github.com/kubewarden/rust-policy-template[template project].

First, install `cargo-generate`. This requires https://pkgs.org/download/openssl-devel[openssl-devel].

[source,shell]
----
cargo install cargo-generate
----

Now scaffold the project as follows:

[source,shell]
----
cargo generate --git https://github.com/kubewarden/rust-policy-template \
               --branch main \
               --name demo
----

The command produces output like:

[source,console]
----
ðŸ”§   Creating project called `demo`...
âœ¨   Done! New project created /<some-path-name>/demo
----

This creates the new policy project in the `demo` sub-directory.

[NOTE]
====
If you plan to make use of the GitHub container registry functionality in the demo, you need to https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/enabling-improved-container-support-with-the-container-registry#enabling-the-container-registry-for-your-personal-account[enable improved container support].
======= Testing

You can try:

[source,console]
----
cargo test
----

This tests the generated scaffolding. If everything is correctly in place youâ€™ll see a series of compilation messages ending with output like:

[source,console]
----
running 4 tests
test settings::tests::validate_settings ... ok
test tests::accept_request_with_non_pod_resource ... ok
test tests::accept_pod_with_valid_name ... ok
test tests::reject_pod_with_invalid_name ... ok

test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
