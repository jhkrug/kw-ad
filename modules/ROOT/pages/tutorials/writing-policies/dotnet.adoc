Currently, .NET Core has experimental support for the WebAssembly WASI platform. This is from the https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/dotnet-wasi-sdk[`dotnet-wasi-sdk`] project.

[NOTE]
====
You don’t need a Windows installation to write or run .NET Core code. Everything can be done also on a Linux or on an macOS machine.
====== Current state

Policy authors can use the following resources:

* https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-sdk-dotnet[Kubewarden .NET Core SDK]: this provides a set of objects and functions that simplify the process of writing policies.
* https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-sdk-dotnet/tree/main/example[Kubewarden policy example]: this is an example of a working policy.

No limitations are known. The SDK enables writing both validating and mutating policies.

It’s possible to use the https://www.nuget.org/packages/KubernetesClient.Models[`KubernetesClient.Models`] library to deal with the Kubernetes objects.

== Project template

Currently, we don’t have a project template that can scaffold a C# policy.

Please, https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-sdk-dotnet/issues[open an issue] if interested.
