= Logging

The Go SDK integrates with the https://github.com/francoispqt/onelog[`onelog`] project, almost out of the box.

The project has chosen this library as:

* It works with WebAssembly binaries. Other popular logging solutions canâ€™t compile to target WebAssembly.
* It provides https://github.com/francoispqt/onelog#benchmarks[good performance].
* It supports structured logging.

== Initialize logger

You need to initialize a logger structure. By performing this initialization in a global variable, you can log from the two main policy entry points: `validate` and `validate_settings`.

In the main package, `main.go` there is initialization for the logger:

[source,go]
----
var (
    logWriter = kubewarden.KubewardenLogWriter{}
    logger    = onelog.New(
        &logWriter,
        onelog.ALL, // shortcut for onelog.DEBUG|onelog.INFO|onelog.WARN|onelog.ERROR|onelog.FATAL
    )
)
----

== Consuming the logger

Now, you can use the `logger` object to log from wherever required your policy:

[source,go]
----
func validate(payload []byte) ([]byte, error) {
    // ...
    logger.Info("validating request")
    // ...
}
----

You can add structured logging:

[source,go]
----
func validate(payload []byte) ([]byte, error) {
    // ...
    logger.WarnWithFields("logging something important", func(e onelog.Entry) {
        e.String("one_field", "a value")
        e.String("another_field", "another value")
    })
    // ...
}
----

You can refer to the https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/francoispqt/onelog?utm_source=godoc[`onelog` documentation] for more information.

Policy logging goes to the policy evaluator (for example, `kwctl` or `policy-server`), and they log on behalf of the policy. They use mechanisms that are interoperable with other components that enable distributed tracing such as https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger].
