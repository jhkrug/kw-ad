= Distributing policy

Itâ€™s been a lengthy, and hopefully enjoyable, wander through the Go tutorial, congratulations for having made it this far ðŸŽ‰.

During this tutorial youâ€™ve recreated the https://github.com/kubewarden/safe-labels-policy[safe-labels-policy].

Thereâ€™s nothing special to do when it comes to distributing a policy. If you followed this guide, you have already published your policy using the GitHub `release.yml` Action defined in the last chapter.

The topic of distributing policies is covered in greater depth in the link:../../../explanations/distributing-policies.md[``distributing policies''] section of Kubewardenâ€™s documentation.
