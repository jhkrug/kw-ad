Kubewarden exposes relevant platform metrics allowing cluster administrators and policy developers to identify patterns and potential issues.

== Policy Server

The Policy Server component initializes and runs policies. When receiving requests from the Kubernetes API server, it forwards the request to the policy, returning the response provided by the policy to the Kubernetes API server.

=== Metrics

[NOTE]
====
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/baggage/[Baggage] key-value attributes are added to the metric to provide additional information.
