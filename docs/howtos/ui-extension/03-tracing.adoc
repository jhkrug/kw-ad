Tracing allows collection of fine-grained details about policy evaluations. It’s a useful tool for debugging issues in your Kubewarden deployment and policies.

https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] is used to receive, store, and visualize trace events.

== Prerequisites

Cert-Manager and OpenTelemetry are required. Follow link:../telemetry/10-opentelemetry-qs.md#install-opentelemetry[these instructions] to install Cert Manager and the OpenTelemetry Operator.

== Install Jaeger

Apply the installation steps from the link:../telemetry/20-tracing-qs.md#install-jaeger[tracing quickstart].

Once all the resources are created by the Jaeger operator, there is a Service under `my-open-telemetry-collector.jaeger.svc.cluster.local`.

The Jaeger Query UI is reachable at the following address:

[source,console]
----
https://<CLUSTER_IP>/api/v1/namespaces/jaeger/services/http:my-open-telemetry-query:16686/proxy/search
----

This endpoint may be unique depending on your configuration. You can find the endpoint listed for your Jaeger resource under the Services page.

=== Update `rancher-kubewarden-controller` with Jaeger endpoint

You’ll need to edit the `rancher-kubewarden-controller` resource to add the Jaeger endpoint ``my-open-telemetry-collector.jaeger.svc.cluster.local:4317''.

For instance:

[source,yaml]
----
telemetry:
  tracing:
    enabled: True
    jaeger:
      endpoint: "my-open-telemetry-collector.jaeger.svc.cluster.local:4317"
      tls:
        insecure: true
----

`my-open-telemetry-collector` is the service we installed under the `jaeger` namespace.

[CAUTION]
====
For simplicity, we’re not encrypting the communication between the OpenTelemetry collector and the Jaeger endpoint.

This is *not suitable for production deployment*. We recommend you read Jaeger’s https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/operator/[documentation].
====You should now be able to view any failed requests for policies tied to a specific Policy Server, or the detail view for any given policy. You can get a more in-depth view of the traces by using the Jaeger UI.
